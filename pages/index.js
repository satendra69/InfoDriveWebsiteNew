                        After a rigorous vendor selection process undertaken by
                        my team, we settled on InfoDrive for our SFDC app
                        implementation project. InfoDrive's relevant experience,
                        prompt communication, and positive attitude won us over.
                        And I'm happy to say we made the right decision. <br />
                        Interactions with the team were fluid and pleasant, and
                        they delivered a quality work product on time. <br />
                        We look forward to future engagements with InfoDrive as
                        our needs require.

                        We reached out to InfoDrive to help us build a few
                        technical POC (Proof of Concept) as our internal
                        development teams were extremely busy with other
                        products/projects. InfoDrive was very particularly quick
                        and responsive, they quickly jumped on a call together
                        requirements from us and provided their estimate and
                        proposal in a short time. <br />
                        After a lengthy onboarding process from our side,
                        InfoDrive assigned one of their remarkably capable,
                        knowledgeable Salesforce certified engineers as our main
                        technical person. <br />
                        Iâ€™d also like to point out that the entire team at Info
                        Drive is resourceful, responsive, and flexible. Our
                        assigned engineer easily adopted our internal agile
                        practices and was able to provide feedback on our sprint
                        review and planning, similar to our internal development
                        teams.
